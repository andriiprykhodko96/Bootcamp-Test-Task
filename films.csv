Such Beautiful People;4.9;Dmytro Moyseyev's gorgeous, quiet film, Such Beautiful People, is a simple look at the everyday lives of rural Ukrainian citizens. Taking place largely against the beautiful backdrop along the shores of the Black Sea in Crimea, the movie takes a gentle look at different neighbors and citizens of a small community and their day-to-day lives trying to find meaning outside the hustle and bustle of the big city. It's an artfully shot and slightly melancholic film which reveals the beauty in banality and the dignity in normal, working-class life, Ukrainian or anywhere else.Firecrosser;4;"In Firecrosser, writer/director Mykhailo Illienko tells the dramatic true story of a Ukrainian legend, Ivan Datsenko, who led over 200 combats against the Nazis in World War 2 before becoming decorated with the official title of ""Hero of the Soviet Union"" on September 18, 1943. He was eventually captured as a prisoner of war by the Americans, and the Soviets declared him dead, but the true story is so much more bizarre. Datsenko sneaked his way into Canada, fell in love with a Native woman, and joined her tribe, eventually becoming the Native chief Firecrosser in Montreal, with everyone unaware of his complicated Ukrainian past. It's a larger-than-life story, and the Ukrainian director tells it well."Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom;3.9;The Netflix original Winter on Fire, directed by Evgeny Afineevsky, is a tense Academy Award-nominated documentary about the student uprising which took place in Ukraine in 2013.Julia Blue;3;Roxy Toporowych directs the beautiful Julia Blue, about one of the aforementioned student activists. Having witnessed the chaos in Kyiv, Julia is inspired to leave home and become a photojournalistFeathered Dreams;4.3;Feathered Dreams is a unique production. It's the first English-language Ukrainian movie, and it's also a co-production between Ukraine and Nigeria, a country which actually has the fastest growing film industry, termed Nollywood.Generation Maidan;5;Another excellent documentary which looks at the revolutionary Ukrainian combat of 2014, Generation Maidan is a lot more uplifting and less dark than Winter on Fire, but just as brilliant. The film partially picks up where Winter on Fire left off, following the Ukrainian protestors as they battle corrupt oligarchs, businessmen, and pro-Russian separatists.Hunger For Truth: The Rhea Clyman Story;4.2;An extremely painful documentary, Hunger For Truth: The Rhea Clyman Story tells the heartbreaking story of journalist Rhea Clyman, one of the few people in the world (who wasn't killed) to investigate and report on the disinformation campaign of Stalinist bureaucrats and police surrounding the intentional starvation and mass famine which killed nearly four million people in the 1930sThe Guide;5;The 2014 Ukrainian drama The Guide from Oles Sanin is a tense, gritty, and incredible historical film which depicts the repression of the Ukrainian identity in the 1930s. The haunting and visually stunning film follows a boy, whose American father is killed by NKVD agents for possession of state secrets1;2;3
